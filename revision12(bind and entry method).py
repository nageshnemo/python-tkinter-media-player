# python provides us another powerful way of event handling using a method called bind
# this method is included in all the widgets and has the folowing syntax
# syntax = <obj name>.bind("<event>",handler)
# event = a case sensitive string that contains detail about which event to listen for
# handler = the name of the function to call when the event occurs
